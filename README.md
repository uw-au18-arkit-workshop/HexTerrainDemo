# HexTerrainDemo


This repo serves to demo an implementation of HexTerrain for the workshop.



## Goals

- Implement hex-shaped terrain
- Use heightmaps (vs. voxels or some other math things)
- Place this terrain on a Plane (keep in bounds, etc.)

We should try to complete this in **1-1.5 weeks**, in order to allow time to focus on gameplay and the like. 
This is half of our available time, and it's pretty modular to implement, so we might end up staggering the terrain work to finish the features we want.

## Branches

TODO

## Architecture
